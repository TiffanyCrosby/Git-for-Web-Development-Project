1. What is Semantic HTML? 
It is giving meaning to what we are writing and filling a webpage with. It organizes it so that we can manipulate it to do things and design it the way we want.

2. What is HTML used for? 
Its what web browsers read to build a webpage. It’s the basic building block of the web.

3. What is an attribute and where do we put it?
It is a changeable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values. It is put inside a tag after the name of the tag.

4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?

6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document?

7. What is an id? 
IDs are only allowed to be used once per HTML page. Use IDs for very specific reasons that can’t be accomplished using a class. Be mindful of where you use IDs as their specificity weight is heavier than most selectors.

8. What elements can I add an id to? 
All of them.

9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
Once. 

10. What is a class?
Class selectors begin to introduce a heavier specificity compared to the element or universal selectors. Classes allow us to select individual elements by placing a special attribute in our HTML. We can use the same class over and over again on many elements.

11. What elements can I add a class to? 
All of them; for example color:, font-size:, background:, padding:, etc.

12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
As many times as you want.

Use the #nameofID.

16. What is the difference between a section and a div?
The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The div tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.


17. What is CSS used for? 
It is used to design the document/webpage.

18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page 
It depends on the element. There are different symbols to be used when calling on different attributes. Ex. h2{}

19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
An id is more specific than a class and can only be used once. A class is less specific than id but more specific than universal and divs, etc.; it can be used multiple times in a document.
Class could be used when you want only some elements to have a certain attribute like only the first and third paragraph in the document is a certain font with huge font-size. An id would be used when you want one specific thing to stand out such as a specific paragraph or sentence that you want bolded and huge font-size and a different color.

20. How do we select classes in CSS?
Use .nameofclass

21. How do we select a p element with a single class of â€œhumanâ€â€?
p .â€œhumanâ€â€ , if you want to be very specific then you can make sure there is no space between the p and the “.” That starts the class selection.

22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
It is when you are calling an attribute by the parent first and then putting in the child selector so that you can be very specific about a certain characteristic you want that attribute to have. It’s useful when you need to override a class element in the child selector.

Stretch Questions

38. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
You can't put block elements inside inline elements. Formatting. By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow. Block elements, on the other hand, typically cause a line break to occur 

39. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 

40. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? display:inline-block

41. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
	div, p, nav

42. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
The box model has an image/paragraph/whatever and makes it so that it fits into a box by giving padding, margin, borders to create an illusion of a box. You could just put most of those elements into the elements themselves.
